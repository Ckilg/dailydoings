# CoP Jamstack Boilerplate
Boilerplate code for the Webapps Community of Practice Jamstack evening on the 15th of April, 2020.

Used as a three-step rocket to let people become familiar with:
1. Deploying a static site to Netlify from a git repo
2. Templates & generating a static site from them with Eleventy
3. Sourcing Data from the Contentful API & webhooking this together
